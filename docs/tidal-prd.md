# Tidal: Solana-First Consumer DeFi Product

**Version:** 2.1
**Date:** March 9, 2026
**Status:** Active — replaces v1 hackathon PRD
**Transition:** EVM hackathon prototype (Base) → Solana-first consumer product
**Team:** 0xSardius (engineering) + 0xJulo (design engineering)

---

## Executive Summary

Tidal is an AI-powered DeFi yield advisor that makes Solana DeFi accessible, safe, and effortless. Users tell Tidal their risk comfort level, and the AI finds, explains, and executes the best yield strategies across Solana protocols — in plain English.

### One-Liner

> "Your AI tidekeeper for Solana DeFi."

### Why Solana-First

- 77% of AI agent transaction volume happens on Solana (Franklin Templeton, Dec 2025)
- 400ms finality + sub-cent fees = instant, frictionless UX
- $11.5B DeFi TVL with deep lending/staking markets
- No consumer-grade AI yield advisor exists on Solana today
- 20M+ Phantom users = massive addressable market already on-chain

### Product Philosophy

**Help consumers use DeFi as easily and seamlessly as possible — no wallet juggling, no protocol hopping, no jargon.** The user says what they want ("I want to earn yield on my USDC"), and Tidal handles everything: finding the best rate, explaining the risks, and executing the transaction.

### Core Value Proposition

- **For Solana users** who want to earn yield but find DeFi protocols overwhelming
- **Tidal** eliminates complexity with an AI that explains every action, personalizes by risk, and executes transactions
- **Unlike** raw protocol UIs (Kamino, Jupiter, Drift) that assume expertise
- **Unlike** DeFAI token projects (Griffain, Virtuals) that are speculative, not functional
- **Tidal** is a working product where every recommendation is explained and every action is transparent

---

## Problem Statement

1. **Yield is everywhere on Solana** — Kamino ($3B TVL), Jupiter Lend ($1.6B), Jito ($2.9B), Sanctum, Drift, Marinade — but comparing them requires protocol-by-protocol research
2. **Security is a real concern** — $250M+ stolen from Solana users in H1 2025 via phishing and malicious approvals. Users need help understanding what they're signing.
3. **No standard vault interface** — Unlike EVM's ERC-4626, every Solana protocol has a unique API. This makes building universal tools hard (and is therefore a moat once built).
4. **Yield changes constantly** — The best option last week may not be the best option today. Manual monitoring is exhausting.

## Target Users

### Primary: "Solana Sophie"

- Has SOL and USDC in Phantom, trades on Jupiter sometimes
- Knows staking exists, has maybe staked SOL natively
- Doesn't understand the difference between Kamino, Marginfi, and Jupiter Lend
- Wants to earn yield without becoming a full-time DeFi researcher
- **Quote:** "I have SOL and USDC sitting in my wallet. I know I should be earning something but I don't know which protocol to trust."

### Secondary: "Busy Builder Brian"

- DeFi-literate, has used multiple Solana protocols
- Time-constrained — checking Kamino vs Jupiter Lend vs Drift daily is unsustainable
- Wants optimization handled for him
- **Quote:** "I know what I'm doing but I don't have time to do it every day."

## Product Architecture

### Risk Tiers (Unchanged — Tidal's Core UX)

| Tier | Name           | Solana Strategies                    | Target APY | Protocols                                              |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Shallows**   | Liquid staking, stablecoin lending   | 4-8%       | JitoSOL, Kamino USDC, Jupiter Lend USDC                |
| 2    | **Mid-Depth**  | Single-asset lending, curated vaults | 8-15%      | Kamino Earn Vaults, Jupiter Lend, Drift lending        |
| 3    | **Deep Water** | Leveraged yield, LP positions        | 15%+       | Jupiter Multiply, Kamino LP (Orca), Drift perp funding |

## Features (Phased)

### Phase 1: Solana Foundation (MVP — 3-4 weeks)

**Product philosophy**: Help consumers use DeFi as easily and seamlessly as possible. No wallet juggling, no protocol hopping, no jargon. The user says what they want, the AI handles the rest.

**F1: Solana Wallet Connection**

- Connect Phantom, Backpack, or Privy embedded wallet
- Email/social login creates an embedded Solana wallet automatically (zero friction)
- Display SOL, USDC, and major token balances
- Show current staking/lending positions if any

**F2: JitoSOL Staking (Shallows — SOL holders)**

- Stake SOL → receive JitoSOL (~5.9% APY)
- Unstake JitoSOL → receive SOL
- Display position value and earned rewards
- AI explains MEV tips and staking mechanics in plain English

**F3: Kamino USDC Lending (Shallows — stablecoin holders)**

- Supply USDC to Kamino Lend
- Withdraw USDC + interest
- Read live APY from Kamino
- AI compares Kamino rate vs Jupiter Lend in real-time

**F4: Jupiter Lend USDC (Shallows — stablecoin holders)**

- Supply USDC to Jupiter Lend vaults
- Withdraw USDC + interest
- Read live APY from Jupiter Lend
- AI compares vs Kamino and recommends the better rate
- Example: "Kamino is at 4.2%, but Jupiter Lend has 5.8% right now. Both are solid for your risk level. Want me to go with Jupiter Lend?"

**F5: Jupiter Swap Integration**

- Swap any Solana token via Jupiter Ultra API
- AI uses this automatically when user has the wrong token for a strategy
- "You have SOL but want stablecoin yield. I'll swap to USDC first, then deposit."
- Route display showing path and rate

**F6: AI Tools (Solana)**

- `stakeSOL` — Prepare JitoSOL staking transaction
- `lendUSDC` — Prepare Kamino OR Jupiter Lend supply transaction (AI picks the better rate)
- `withdrawLend` — Withdraw from either lending protocol
- `swapToken` — Prepare Jupiter swap
- `scanSolanaYields` — Scan DeFi Llama for Solana opportunities
- `getSolanaRates` — Live APY from on-chain protocol reads
- `compareYields` — Side-by-side comparison of stablecoin yield options

**F7: Risk-Tiered Recommendations**

- Reuse risk depth selection UI from v1
- AI filters strategies by tier
- Shallows users see: JitoSOL staking + Kamino/Jupiter Lend stablecoin yield
- Explain risk in plain English before every action
- "This is a Shallows-safe strategy. Your USDC stays as USDC — you earn interest, and you can withdraw anytime."

### Phase 2: Protocol Expansion + Differentiation (3 weeks)

**F8: Kamino Curated Earn Vaults (Mid-Depth)**

- Deposit into Gauntlet/Steakhouse curated vaults

- Integrated with Drift's cross-margin system
- AI surfaces when Drift rates beat Kamino/Jupiter

**F11: Transaction Explanation Engine**

- Before every signature, show plain-English breakdown of what the transaction does
- Flag unusual patterns (high slippage, unknown programs, excessive token approvals)
- "This transaction will stake 10 SOL with Jito and give you 9.83 JitoSOL in return. You can unstake anytime."

**F12: Protocol Risk Scoring**

- Display per-protocol: audit status, TVL trend, age, exploit history
- AI references these in recommendations: "Kamino has been audited by OtterSec and Kudelski, $3B TVL, no exploits."

### Phase 3: Intelligence + Differentiation (3 weeks)

**F13: Auto-Rebalancing**

- Monitor yield rates on a schedule (Vercel Cron)
- Alert user when a better opportunity appears
- Autopilot mode: auto-execute rebalance if delta > threshold
- "Kamino USDC dropped to 3.1%, Jupiter Lend is offering 5.8%. Want me to move your funds?"

**F14: Portfolio View**

- Unified view of all Solana positions (staking, lending, LP)
- Show total yield earned, current APY, allocation breakdown
- Historical performance chart

**F15: DeFi Education Mode**

- Contextual explanations triggered by user questions

## Competitive Analysis

| Product              | What They Do                       | Tidal's Edge                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Griffain**         | Agent token platform ($457M mcap)  | We're a product, not a token. Working UX, not speculation.                  |
| **The Hive**         | Multi-agent investment system      | Risk personalization, plain-English explanations, consumer UX               |
| **SendAI Agent Kit** | Developer toolkit (60+ actions)    | Consumer product on top of infra. Different layer.                          |
| **Phantom**          | Wallet with built-in swaps/staking | We're the AI advisor Phantom doesn't have. Route users to optimal protocol. |
| **Jupiter**          | Swap aggregator + lending          | We route TO Jupiter when it's the best option. Complementary.               |
| **Step Finance**     | Solana portfolio dashboard         | We act on data, not just display it. AI executes.                           |

**Key insight**: The Solana AI-DeFi space is crowded with infrastructure and speculative tokens but thin on consumer-grade yield management. Tidal occupies the "advisor layer" — we don't compete with protocols, we route users to the right one.

## What We're Carrying Forward from v1

| Asset                                         | Status      | Reusability                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Risk depth UX (Shallows/Mid-Depth/Deep Water) | Shipped     | 100% — brand and concept transfer |
| AI agent + chat interface                     | Shipped     | 90% — new tools, same UX          |
| DeFi Llama yield scanning                     | Shipped     | 100% — already scans Solana       |
| Landing page + brand                          | Shipped     | 95% — update copy                 |
| Tool architecture pattern (AI SDK v6)         | Shipped     | 80% — new adapters, same shape    |
| Test infrastructure (293 tests, vitest)       | Shipped     | 70% — new protocol tests          |
| Ocean metaphor + brand voice                  | Established | 100%                              |
| ActionCard component pattern                  | Shipped     | 85% — adapt for Solana tx types   |

### What We're Leaving Behind

- EVM chain configs (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism) — park, don't delete
- Li.Fi SDK integration — park for future cross-chain phase
- AAVE V3 adapters — EVM-only, not needed for Solana
- ERC-4626 vault adapter — no equivalent on Solana
- Wagmi hooks — replaced by Solana wallet adapter hooks

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Wallet**: Privy with `walletChainType: 'ethereum-and-solana'`. External connectors for Phantom/Backpack, embedded wallets for new users. Already integrated for EVM — Solana is a config change.
2. **Swaps**: Jupiter Ultra API direct. 2 endpoints (`/order` → sign → `/execute`), no RPC needed (Beam relayer handles tx landing), 2-10 bps fees. Li.Fi only makes sense when we add cross-chain bridging later.
3. **Team**: 0xSardius (engineering) + 0xJulo (design engineering).
4. **Testing**: Mainnet with small amounts. Kamino/Jupiter/Jito don't have reliable devnet deployments.

## Open Questions

1. **Colosseum timing**: When is the next hackathon cycle? This determines Phase 1 deadline.
2. **Jupiter API key**: Free tier (60 req/min) sufficient for launch? Or need Pro tier?
3. **Integrator fees**: Should we add a fee on Jupiter swaps from day one? (Keep 80% of fee revenue.)
